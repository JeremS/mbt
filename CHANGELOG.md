# Changes

## [14] - 2020-10-05
### Changes
- Reverted to using only the project's deps ase the base confing `...mbt.alpha.default/config`.
Still merges the maven repos from user and system deps though.

### Fixed 
- The regex parsing the version number in the git distance scheme used to return only the last digit of said number.
  Bumping from v9 to v15 would result in bumping to v5 instead. No longer.



## [9] - 2020-09-08
### Changes
- Using all deps sources (system, user and project) in the default config generated by 
`...mbt.alpha.default/config`.

### Fixed 
- The documentation of config keys should have good links to their constructors.

### Added
- Some documentation to the API.
